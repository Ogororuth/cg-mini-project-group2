**GRAPHICS PROJECT 1&2**

This repository has two exciting games; 

**1. BREAKOUT GAME**

A classic arcade game where players control a paddle to break blocks using a bouncing ball. The objective is to destroy all blocks while ensuring the ball doesn't fall below the paddle. With dynamic gameplay, colorful bricks, and increasing difficulty, it’s a test of reflexes and strategy.

The Breakout Block Game features a grid of blocks, a paddle, and a bouncing ball. The goal is simple: break all the blocks to win while ensuring the ball doesn’t fall below the paddle. Players use the left and right arrow keys to control the paddle and aim the ball. With increasing difficulty, blocks become harder to break, adding a layer of complexity.

Key Features

- Dynamic Gameplay: A responsive paddle and a ball that increases speed over time.
- Color-Coded Blocks: Blocks change color to represent their strength, enhancing visuals.
- Scoring and Levels: Tracks your score and progresses you to higher levels.
- Game Over/Win Conditions: The game ends when the ball falls below the paddle or all blocks are destroyed.
